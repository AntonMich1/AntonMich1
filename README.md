Standard projects
This section is a portfolio of Machine Learning projects with Python and various visualization and analysis tools. Most of these projects were carried out within the framework of IBM Data science certifications. They are presented with Jupyter Notebooks. I updated some projects by incorporating more in-depth data analysis, better graphs, advanced ML techniques.
* SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
  
https://github.com/AntonMich1/testrepo/tree/main
In this project, we predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Project includes: SpaceX data collection, Data Wrangling, Webscraping, EDA with SQL Queries & Data visualization, SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard, Launch Sites Locations Analysis with Folium, Machine Learning classification with optimization of hyperparameters and selection of best model: KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression.

Mathematics of Machine Learning. Most of these projects were carried out within the framework of Imperial College Online certifications. They are presented with Jupyter Notebooks. I updated some projects by incorporating more and more interesting questions
